Crash course
==============================================================================

Your team from The Magic Next Telescope (*TMNT*) found a transiting exoplanet candidate using its photometric telescope *Leonardo*. Now it is your job to model it! The discovery report gives you a first guess for the transit signal:

- Epoch: 1.09 +- 0.01 days after start of observations
- Period: 3.41 +- 0.01 days
- R_planet / R_star: 0.10 +- 0.01
- (R_star + R_planet) / semi-major axis: somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3

Simply launch *allesfitter*'s graphical user interface (GUI) via double click on the :download:`launch_allesfitter <_static/launch_allesfitter>` app (for Mac/Windows/Linux). Now fill out the fields step by step, hit the run button, and lean back. All of this is demonstrated in this video tutorial:

.. note:: the video is a bit outdated by now, but still captures 99% of the workflow. The updated crash course on GitHub simplifies and speeds up the modeling. The more advanced tutorials then step by step introduce GPs and more.

Now that you successfully modeled the data, you can schedule follow-up observations with the rest of the TMNT network: *Michelangelo* (photometry), *Donatello* (RV) and *Raphael* (RV). Congratulations!
