Unleash the Bayesian evidence...
=======================================

... for a meaningful model comparison.

- Is there evidence for an occultation? 
- Do you see phase-variations or systematic noise patterns? 
- Are those TTVs meaningful? 
- Is the orbit really eccentric? 

So many questions. So much Bayesian evidence.
